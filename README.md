# Bike-Sharing-Demand

Link to my project:
https://notebooks.azure.com/tkim581/projects/bike-sharing-demand

The data was sourced from: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/

I made a machine learning model using Rainforest Classifier model.
The outcome of the profect is to forecast the demand of Bike-Sharing-Service.
Analysing the historical data including: [Rental-Count, rental_date_time, Season, holiday, workingday, weather, temp, atemp, humidity], I was able to forecast the number of Bike-Sharing-Service count per hour.

I believe such businesses could benifit alot from my prediction if they make a right use of it with distributional data of GPS.
